          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p>Each year, hundreds of people fall victim to unsafe driving. In 2017 alone, distracted driving led to the deaths of 3166 people [1]. On the other hand, drowsy driving caused up to 800 deaths in a single year [2]. These statistics show an urgent need to improve driver safety. Although newer cars such as Teslas do have features to detect drowsiness using cameras and in-car sensors, this type of technology does not exist in older models, and as such is mostly inaccessible to the vast majority of the population, especially those that are financially unprivileged. Our solution is to use earables, a wearable wristband, and the user’s phone to cost effectively create safer driving practices in any car model. While driving, simple gestures such as shaking or tilting the head can be used to decline or accept calls, or to change songs on Spotify. These small changes can help to reduce distracted driving by keeping the driver focused on the road rather than on their phones. For drowsiness, the earables can be used to detect patterns of fatigue, while the wristband can keep track of their heart rate. If both inputs indicate drowsiness, the phone can then ask if the user wants to stop at a nearby coffee shop/rest area. The user can either accept or decline the new route by shaking his or her head. Hopefully, this solution will improve driver safety while being accessible to all drivers.</p>

          <h3>Past Work to Current Solution</h3>
          <p>There has been a lot of prior technology regarding distracted and drowsy driving. For distracted driving, there are several apps that can be used to block calls and incoming texts [3]. However, drivers might not want to use these apps in case the call is important. If drivers are still going to accept calls or change their songs while driving, the next best possible solution is to use a technology that can minimize these distractions. Earables can provide a solution to do so by allowing the driver to make these decisions without having to look directly at their phone or press a button. By using simple head gestures, the driver can perform these tasks with less risk. In the case of drowsy driving, many of these solutions require cameras or sensors integrated within the car. For example, one solution uses IR sensors embedded in the driver’s headrest to track their head position and determine if the driver is drowsy [4]. Other solutions for drowsy driving include using cameras to look at the driver’s blink rate or using the steering wheel to detect the driver’s movements [5]. This, however, would require expensive equipment and can be cumbersome to use. In one case, a research group from Hong Kong Baptist University uses the smartphone’s camera instead to look for signs of drowsiness. The only catch is that the smartphone’s camera must be in direct view of the driver’s face, which is usually inconvenient for the driver [6]. Our method will take advantage of analyzing a person’s head movements using the earables. Additionally, there have been several studies that show drowsiness is linked to changes in the heart rate [7][8]. Therefore, we will try to incorporate heart rate variability (HRV) as one of the inputs as well. This will be done using a wearable wristband to monitor the person’s heart rate. Furthermore, most past solutions use lights and sounds to notify the driver of their drowsy state. However, this might do little to get the driver off the road. With our solution, we hope to guide the driver to a safe location within a short amount of time. This will be done by providing the driver with the option to redirect their route to a nearby coffee shop. The choice is still up to the driver, but at least it provides a convenient option without the hassle of the driver having to do it themselves.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Earables: The earables will be used to detect head gestures. It will serve this function in two ways. First, the user will be able to interact with their phones hands-free. Secondly, the earables will notice patterns in head movements to identify if the user is drowsy.
            <li>Wrist Sensor: The wrist sensor will be used to detect heart rate, specifically heart rate variablility (HRV). Once this is working, the wristband should notify the user if there is a considerable drop in HRV. This would indicate that the user is drowsy.
            <li>Phone App: The phone app will be used to take information from the user and respond accordingly. It will only activate if the phone detects that the car is actually moving. For drowsy driving, it will take inputs from both the earables and the wrist sensor to determine whether or not the driver is drowsy. If so, the driver will be given the option to take an alternate shorter route to a nearby coffee shop/rest area. This message will only appear once every 30 minutes. The driver can accept or decline using the earables. Other features for the phone app include using the earables to accept/decline calls (high priority) and being able to change songs on Spotify (lower priority).

          <p>For now, we plan on splitting the work evenly. Once we get the resources, we will have a better idea on how the work will be divided. Initially, one person might focus on the earables, while the other person will be more responsible for the wristband.</p>
